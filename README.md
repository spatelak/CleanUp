# CleanUp
Prompts you to remove random files or old files from your system to help it keep clean.

## System Requirements
Currently built to work on mac

## Funtionalities
- Hard-coded to look in the Downloads directory, since that seems to be the most cluttered for me. I'll be adding code to make it look in other directories too. You can hard-code it to look in the directory of your choice.
- Randomly chooses between giving you a random file or the oldest file.
- Moves a file to TRASH if you want to delete it.

## To Be Added
- Allow scanning multiple directories for removing junk files
- Propmt to remove least recently opened file
- Modify the terminal application to make an involuntary prompt for user
